# Blastbot Bridge Add-on for Home Assistant

Provides a way for using all Blastbot device functionalities locally in a Home Assistant installation, without needing the cloud for day-to-day functionality.

**Please note:** During setup you will be asked to input a user and password for a Blastbot Cloud account, this is only for fetching AC and IR control codes from the Cloud catalog during the initial setup of a device, if you don't use this, you will still be able to use your devices, but you will need to manually learn each IR command (This only applies to IR and AC controls).

You can create a Blastbot Cloud account for free here: https://cloud.blastbot.io
